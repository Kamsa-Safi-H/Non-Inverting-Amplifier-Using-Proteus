## Theory
A Non-Inverting Amplifier is a closed-loop amplifier configuration in which the input is applied to the non-inverting terminal (+) of the op-amp.
The output signal is amplified and remains in phase with the input signal.
## Procedure
1.	Open Proteus software.
2.	Select μA741, resistors, signal generator, and CRO.
3.	Connect circuit in non-inverting configuration.
4.	Set R1 = 10kΩ and Rf = 100kΩ.
5.	Apply ±15V supply.
6.	Give input sine wave of 1V, 1kHz.
7.	Run simulation.
8.	Observe input and output waveforms.

## Viva Questions
1.	What is a Non-Inverting Amplifier?
    ANS : A non-inverting amplifier is an op-amp circuit in which the input signal is applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal and the output voltage is amplified without phase inversion.
2.	What is the gain formula?
    ANS : Av​=1+R1​/Rf​​
3.	Why is output in phase?
    ANS : Because the input signal is applied to the non-inverting terminal, the output follows the same polarity as the input.
4.	What happens if Rf increases?
    ANS : The voltage gain of the amplifier increases.
5.	What is the input impedance of non-inverting amplifier?
    ANS : Very high (ideally infinite).
